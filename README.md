# feature-engineering-matlab

Abstract — This paper was produced as part of the Master’s in Software Engineering, ministered at the University of Madeira, Artificial Neural Networks unit. The proposed assignment was devised to 
grasp the concept of Featured Engineering, followed by working through a few common techniques to have a rich set of suitable features for solving a machine learning problem. 
For this specific case study, MATLAB © software suite will be used to perform the data manipulation necessary, as well as plot the required graphs.
